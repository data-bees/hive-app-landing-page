      <h3 style="text-align:center">Who are we?</h3>
      <p>We are a market research company based in Dublin, Ireland and we have been around for 5 years.</p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center">What do we do?</h3>
      <p>We help our corporate clients make better investment decisions by providing them with insights into consumers&#39; shopping behaviour.</p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center">What emails can we access?</h3>
      <p>We will only access and use the purchase receipts and order confirmations in your email inbox. We will never collect personal email data.</p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center">Why are we collecting data?</h3>
      <p>Our goal is to better understand the companies you purchase from. The data we collect from your receipts is added to our dataset, the Data Vault, which is summarized in company research reports that investors can then purchase. We never collect personal email data and we never share personal details of our panelists with our clients. We have never sold, do not sell, and will never sell data for advertising, profiling or reidentification purposes.</p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center">Why does my email service warn me that someone is using IMAP from another location?</h3>
      <p>We use IMAP to connect to your email inbox - no stress, this is perfectly normal!</p>
